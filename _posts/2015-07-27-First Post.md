Just to make sure that everything works porperly. That the creating workflow works. And that I understand it
It will also serve as a mission statement(?). At least something that I cna refer to in the futur to help me figure out what to do with this. To push me in a desireable(?) direction. Without being exactly sure of the direction, I can be fairly certain that at least having a consistent target willl be helpfull. I don't think i'll be too dogmatic about it. It can easely change. But over a longer (more mid term) period. Having it written down will at least force be to follow it at least to the poing where I can evaluate it fairly and adjust it acrodingly. 
The reason for this site is:

- Create a place on the net. Regardless of all the time i spend online, I have almost no presence/footprint. 
- Get mpre comftarble sharing/creating/posting.
- Hopefully end up hepling peolpe. 
- Push me/force me to finish and publish personal projects.
- Improve my skills, get more comfortable with what i do.
- Create a portfolio
- Write more better ( :)
- Put a some order and clear out my thoughts/positions/etc.  

I think thats it  for now.
